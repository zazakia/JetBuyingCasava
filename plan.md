# JetBuyingCasava Project Plan

## Project Overview
JetBuyingCasava is a comprehensive farmers management system designed to track farmers, lands, crops, and transactions. The application provides real-time data synchronization, offline capabilities, and analytics for agricultural management.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Storage)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)

## Database Schema
### cassavajet Schema
- **farmers**: Core information about farmers
- **lands**: Land details and locations
- **crops**: Crop planting and harvesting data
- **transactions**: Financial and product transactions
- **sync_log**: Tracks synchronization status for offline functionality

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Database Setup & Migration
- [x] Create cassavajet schema
- [x] Define database tables and relationships
- [ ] Execute schema in Supabase
- [ ] Set up RLS policies
- [ ] Create necessary indexes

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] User authentication and authorization
- [ ] Farmer management (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Land management
- [ ] Crop tracking
- [ ] Transaction processing
- [ ] Data synchronization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Reporting tools
- [ ] Offline functionality
- [ ] Data export/import

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Deployment to production

## Current Focus
- Completing database migration to cassavajet schema
- Setting up proper RLS policies
- Ensuring data integrity and relationships

## Next Steps
1. Execute CASSAVAJET_SCHEMA.sql in Supabase
2. Verify all tables and relationships
3. Update frontend to use new schema
4. Test CRUD operations
5. Implement RLS policies

## Notes
- All database operations should use the `cassavajet` schema
- Follow TypeScript types for data consistency
- Maintain proper error handling and user feedback
- Document all API endpoints and database queries
